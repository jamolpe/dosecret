In order to have this project running you need a .env file (or environment variables in current instance) with cognito configuration. Local env can run with a "static" user auth that does not consume cognito

## Folders

- Config -> configuration files
- Controllers -> application rest functions
- Core -> application core logic
- Helpers -> common application helpers
- Middlewares -> application middlewares
- Models -> application common models
- Routes -> public and private routes definition
- Services -> external data providers (databases or external apis)
- server.ts -> entry point
